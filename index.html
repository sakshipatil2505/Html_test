    <body><p>A specific kind of word play traditionally called paronomasia, or 
    more currently called a paragram, changes one or more lette
    rs of a word or expression to create humor or irony or, Collins 
    (2004) suggests, to achieve 'dramatic, critical--or bathetic--
    effect' (p. 129). Thus, Swan Lake becomes Swine Lake in a Marshall
     book (1999) about pigs performing a ballet; a chapter hsgd.
